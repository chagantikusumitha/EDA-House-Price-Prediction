### 1. Data Collection 
Data collection is a process of gathering information from all the relevant sources and sorting it in a systematic order which is easily understandable.   
Here, We have used a website called https://www.makaan.com/real-estate-hyderabad-property for collecting data.
We have collected data by using Web Scrapping
##### Web Scrapping :
       Web scraping is a software technique of extracting information from the website .
       It  takes the unstructured data into structured data that can be stored and analyzed.
       We have to send a request to the URL of the webpage we want to access .  
       If we get the status code as 200 we can scrap the HTML  context  from webpage.
       BeautifulSoup is a python library for extracting  the data from HTML files.

 In this way after collecting the data we have stored it systematically in a Data Frame
